# Tic Tac Toe Game in C
## Discription :-
Here, I have created a Tic-tac-toe game using Python language.
This game is similar to my other [Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/MaliDipak/tic_tac_toe-game-in-C) game that I created using C language.
This is simple console based game.

## What is Tic Tac Toe?
Tic-tac-toe, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
Itâ€™s no doubt, we must have played Tic Tac Toe in our school days and every one of us loves to play the game. You will be surprised to know that the game of Tic Tac Toe is known to exist since ancient Egypt times.
