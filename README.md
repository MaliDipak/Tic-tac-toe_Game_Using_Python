# Tic Tac Toe Game in C
## Discription :-
Here, I have created a tic-tac-toe game using Python language.
This game is similar to my other tic-tac-toe game that I created using C language.

Tic-tac-toe, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
